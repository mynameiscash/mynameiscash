<strong> Verse 1 </strong>
<div>As a child, there was a dream,</div>
<div>That I would sail the seven seas,</div>
<div>At least that is what I was told,</div>
<div>A family name I must uphold,</div>
<div>Then I met her on the shore,</div>
<div>A preacher's daughter, I was torn,</div>
<div>I said I would never leave her side,</div>
<div>But then, I left one starry night</div>
<div><strong>Chorus 1</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Now I'm on a ship that's sinking,</div>
<div>Wondering why I didn't listen,</div>
<div>To my heart that tells me why,</div>
<div>I was born into this life,</div>
<div>I wish we didn't always do,</div>
</div>
<div>To what we're told</div>
<div><strong>Verse 2</strong></div>
<div>As a teen, I lost my family,</div>
<div>I felt alone with those around me,</div>
<div>Then I grew a little older,</div>
<div>Downtown streets became my home,</div>
<div>I never really made enough,</div>
<div>Till my friends told me of a job,</div>
<div>If I sold at the right price,</div>
<div>I could have a better life</div>
<div><strong>Chorus 2</strong></div>
<div>All this time, I was mistaken</div>
<div>Behind these bars, I am realizing,</div>
<div>All the ones who have shown me why,</div>
<div>I was born into this life,</div>
<div>I wish that we would reason</div>
<div>With what we're told</div>
<div><strong>Bridge</strong></div>
<div>I wish our eyes could see more than present reality,</div>
<div>We’d know what others need and stand up to take the lead</div>
<div>And challenge what we’re told</div>
<div><strong>Verse 3</strong></div>
<div>Here in my office chair,</div>
<div>I am wondering what I am doing here,</div>
<div>Did I make the right choose by</div>
<div>letting silence become my voice</div>
<div><strong>Chorus 1</strong></div>
<div>Now I'm on a ship that's sinking,</div>
<div>Wondering why I didn't listen,</div>
<div>To my heart that tells me why,</div>
<div>I was born into this life,</div>
<div>I wish we didn't always do</div>
<div>To what we're told</div>
