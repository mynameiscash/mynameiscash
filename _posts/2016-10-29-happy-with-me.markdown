<strong>Verse 1</strong>

I’ve been trying to find a way to stick to you

But glue won't work, no matter I  try

Seems your love is an unfolding rose

When you open no one knows

Still, I will wait for every move you make

 

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Hold my hand and feel a spark

Hear the music of my beating heart

Let our love be a candle the lights up the dark

If you ever feel afraid know that my love is here to stay

Just wait and see, you can be, Happy with me

 

<strong>Verse 2</strong>

They may try to tear apart

The adhesive between hearts

But don’t let go cause I will be holding on

Like magnets, we'll repel at times,

But keep the positive in mind,

And know we'll be all right

 

<strong>Bridge </strong>

Like moon and ocean tides, we'll sway all through night

And when you can't go on
