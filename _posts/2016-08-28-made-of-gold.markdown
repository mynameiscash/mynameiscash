<strong><u>Verse 1: </u></strong>

The day is so long, I try to be strong

The world keeps talking, putting words on my mouth

My lips are moving,

No words are coming out,

Words seem to hurt me

Stick, stones they break me,

My tongue has been bitten one too many times

Though I’ve been silent,

I want to speak up now,

<strong><u>Chorus: </u></strong>

Everybody's hurting

But we must keep moving

When we're low,

We must know,

We're made of gold

<strong><u>Verse 2: </u></strong>

I’ve kept eyes down,

Went with the crowd,

But it’s time to turn this situation around,

I've had my bad days,

And I'm tired of falling down,

I'm stuck in limbo

This world moves so slow,

But I’ve learned to wait for the ultimate prize,

We must keep walking to the sunrise
