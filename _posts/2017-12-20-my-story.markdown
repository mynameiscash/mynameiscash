<h3>My life mission:</h3>
<blockquote>To make positive change within my local and global community while exploring my interests in music, technology, sustainability, and education, all while having a bit of fun.</blockquote>

My name is Cash. Yes, you read that correctly. How did I get that name, you may be wondering? Simply put: My parents wanted me to be rich. Unfortunately for them (and me), it hasn't worked out yet. But I am optimistic!

I won't bore you with the little details of my life, but all you need to know is that I live in Buzen, Japan, make music, and eat copious amounts of ice cream. To offset my huge calorie intake, I try to spend as much of my free time being outdoors.

While life has definitely kicked me in the bum <i>(what video below)</i> a few times, it has been filled with amazing experiences and has also allowed me to achieve some of my biggest dreams:

</ol>
When I am not working, I am writing songs, learning new food recipes and languages, cycling and bouldering, or reading a book in my local library. I know life is short; I don't want to waste a minute of it. Send me a message if you want to connect, or if you would like to work with me.
