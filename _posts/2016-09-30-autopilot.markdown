<strong><u>Verse 1:</u></strong>

One moment you are there, then you change to somebody else

Concealing your face

Passing by like clouds in the sky, you find that

Life is just a dream

You’re going through life,

At a blink of an eye, your reflection keeps changing,

Spinning out of control,

Losing ground but you know,

Your heart’s not frozen.

 

<strong><u>Chorus:</u></strong>

Wake out of autopilot,

Come back to life again/ Stand firm through the turbulence,

Break free, Oh break free

From Autopilot

 

<strong><u>Verse 2:</u></strong>

Seconds become years, in a flash before your eyes,

Like clocks flown out a window,

Spiraling like grains of sand, falling faster,

Through an hourglass,

It's time to jumpstart, your will and your heart,

Feel the earth, wind, and fire,

Get up on your feet, and move to the beat,

Life is calling

 

<strong><u>Bridge:</u></strong>

Who is to say that your fantasy can’t become reality,

Cause what you think controls your destiny,

So choose to believe and manifest a new reality
