<h4><strong>Buzen City Website</strong></h4>
This is a <a href="http://buzencity.wordpress.com/things-to-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> I made for Buzen City, Japan. As an English teacher here, I recognized the need for an English Website for foreigners interested in visiting the area. The website was made using the Sketch theme. By collaborating with other English teachers in the area, we were able to make blog posts about life in Buzen and update other English speakers in the area of upcoming festivals.
