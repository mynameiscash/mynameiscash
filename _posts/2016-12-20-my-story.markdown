<h3>My life mission:</h3>
<blockquote>To make positive change within my local and global community while exploring my interests in music, technology, sustainability, and education, all while having a bit of fun.</blockquote>

My name is Cash. Yes, you read that correctly. How did I get that name, you may be wondering? Simply put: My parents wanted me to be rich. Unfortunately for them (and me), it hasn't worked out yet. But I am optimistic!

This website holds all of my original music that I have been working on. I primarily blog on my wordpress website, which can be found here <a href="http://wwww.cashhelman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here</a>.Â
