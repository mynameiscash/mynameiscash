Verse 1:

Telescopes started this celestial hope,

So I knew I had to go, get out of there,

Cause in my plans, shooting stars and all my plans

To build a rocket out of dirt and sand

Get out of here,

I ain't looking back till I make it through.

 

Chorus

I'll keep going till I make it passed mars,

Keep trying to write my name in the stars,

I'll keep going till I make it

On the milky way

I'll find my place somewhere, someday.

 

Verse 2

But all around, an army trying to bring me down

Clouds of thunder try to strike me out

But not today.

Cause now I've learned.

We must keep walking through the solar flares

Keep breathing even with no air

I ain't going back till I make it through.
