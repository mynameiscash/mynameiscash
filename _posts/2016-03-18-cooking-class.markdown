<strong> Cooking Classes in Japan </strong>

Over the last few months, I have been trying to get better at cooking. Like the interests that occurs inside of an retirement account of a 401k, I believe the same thing goes on inside of your body. As it stands, the "investments" I have made in my body consist of ice cream and chocolate chip cookies. 

Thankfully, I was able to find a cooking course that takes place once a month in the local community center in Buzen. The class takes place on the third sunday of every month, and it costs about 500 yen to join. Talk about a deal. You are given the recipe and work in groups of three or four to make the receipes. It really is a great group. 

I have yet to translate all the Japanese recipes into English, but when I do, I will be sure to post them on here.
