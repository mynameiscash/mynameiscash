<strong>Verse 1</strong>
Don't say you don't know,
Don't say you're not sure,
What changed your mind
Please don't call us friends,
There’s still a chance to mend,
Your heavy heart,
What happened to the girl last night,
The one who drank my cherry wine

<strong>Chorus</strong>
Cause according to her you love me,
But according to you, you don't
According to her you need me,
But according to you, you won’t (x2)

<strong>Verse 2</strong>
If there is someone else,
Your honest words would help me understand
I could give you all my love,
But it would never be enough,
if you don’t feel the same
Where is the girl from yesterday,
The one who said she’s here to stay

<strong>Back to Chorus</strong>

<strong>Bridge</strong>
Maybe I drank too much wine,
Maybe you just need some more time,
To help you change your minds,
Baby, I’m not crazy I swear,
I just wish that love was fair,
And the one who loved me was still here.

<strong>Back to Chorus</strong>
