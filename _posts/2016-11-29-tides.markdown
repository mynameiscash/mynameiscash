<strong><u>Verse 1:</u></strong>

We’ve all heard stories of love and glory,

From authored books and words by those unknown,

But there are more that have never been told,

Some lived for honor, some fought for power,

And there were wars, which lasted too many hours,

It seems they’re some things that never change

Maybe we’re just all pretending,

Hoping that we don’t stumble or fall

Or maybe we are all misinformed,

Trying to protect ourselves by building wall

 

<strong><u>Chorus:</u></strong>

Take your time and open up your mind,

Let love and hope fill you inside,

And though sometimes in life, we lose the will to fight,

Know you’ll be all right riding the tides.

 

<strong>Verse 2:</strong>

We’ve searched for elixirs to live forever,

Transformed the Earth to build up wealth in paper,

But maybe real treasure, isn’t measured in gold,

Some think the stars, are who we are,

While others pray we’ll all sing in Heaven,

But maybe there are some things we will never know

No matter what you may believe in,

You all know we’ve all got precious time
