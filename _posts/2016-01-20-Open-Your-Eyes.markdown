<strong>Verse</strong>

The soldiers march into the dark

They say the ends near

We’ve heard their words but taste the dirt

From the shadows we fear

All we’ve known is don’t let go

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Oh, the bombs outside

You can sleep tonight

I will hold tight

Oh, my love, you never know

We could win this fight

By the morning light


<strong>Verse</strong>

We’ve seen the air breath into blood

And how it shares

The fires glow outside our soul

The heat we bear

We could let go

If not for hope.


<strong>Chorus</strong>

Oh, the bombs outside

We can sleep tonight

We will hold on tight

Oh, my love, you never know

We could win this fight

By the morning light


<strong>Bridge</strong>

One day the sound of guns will be gone

And what we waiting for for so long

Will be the morning sun in the dawn.


<strong>Chorus</strong>

Oh, the bombs outside

All I see is light

As I hold you tight

Oh, my love, please don’t let go

You can win this fight

Please just open your eyes
