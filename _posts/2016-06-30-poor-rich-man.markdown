<strong>Verse 1:</strong>

Son, didn't I tell you to don't

Ever make any poor friends,

You must separate yourself

From all of this filth

You come from great wealth

<strong>Chorus 1:</strong>

You are gonna thank me someday

Standing on Gold Hills

You are gonna see it my way

Money spins the world,

<strong>Verse 2:</strong>

Boy, the only son of mine,

Should be spending all his time,

Chasing tail with his young life,

Love is nothing but a word,

So save yourself the hurt,

Experience Mother Earth

<strong>Chorus 2:</strong>

Just give a girl pearls and diamonds

She'll show you her Gold Hills,

Why have one without the other

Money gets the girls

<strong>Bridge:</strong>

One day you'll be a man like me,

You’ll smile at all your memories,

Those nights of girls and being free

And how money makes life easy.

<strong>Verse 3</strong>

Son, I was not around,

But I am here now,

I wish I didn't leave your mother

Boy, I know I've made mistakes,

My money's all but change

I now I wait for the hands of fate

<strong>Chorus 3:</strong>

In death, You can't bring all your wealth

To Heaven's Golden Hills

If only I had known sooner

That money ain’t the world

<strong>Verse 4:</strong>

Oh, my Son, your life has just begun,

But let me tell you something

About a poor, rich man
