<strong> Traveling for the first time </strong>

As a child, I was afraid of airplanes. I was raised in a Filipino home, and my relatives strongly believed that humans were meant for land-dwelling. Therefore, any form of traveling that didn't include motor vehicles, bikes, or legs, was a vehicle on the fast lane to death.  If I was invited to a beach party, my mother was always reluctant to let me go because she was afraid that if I went, she could lose me forever. It should be noted that my mother also couldn't swim, which seems really strange to me now that I am older, considering the fact that we lived on an island in the Pacific Ocean.  I thankfully had an American father, who was adamant about me learning how to swim.

This changed when one of my relatives in the Philippines died.  To not attend the funeral was not an option.

I was 7 years old when I first traveled on a plane. While I don t think this is what initially sparked my interest in traveling, as the brain of 7-year-old me was only focused on two things: ice cream and Pokemon, it was the first time I was able to experience a life different from mine. And that was cool.

I also love watching movies on planes. It is a great way to pass the time and keep up with all the new films being released. While on this flight, the first film I watched was <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspector Gadget</span>. What I didn't know was that the language settings could be changed.  I remember looking over at my sister laughing. I thought she was so cool for being able to understand the movie, and that the only reason she could understand it, was because she was a middle school student learning high-level English. It wasn't until after we got off the plane when I praised my sister for being able to understand the movie that I realized I had watched the entire movie in Spanish. I obviously wasn't the smartest kid growing up. My sister still teases me for watching <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspector Gadget</span> in Spanish.

In the Philippines, the things that brought me the most enjoyment upon arrival were the glass coke bottles, sold on the street for a mere 15 pesos. I just remember ordering one every time I saw a drink stand. I also remember riding on a Jeepney for the first time. Not being restrained by a seat belt was exhilarating. My mother had to hold me down as all I wanted to do was hang from the end of the back entrance. And lastly, the Let's go fishing Game brought me so much joy, that we brought it back home with us to America. It would become my life for about two months before the AA batteries ran out of juice. (At the time, I thought I had broken it. If only I knew batteries existed...) I still always smile when I walk into a store and see that they are still being sold.

There were also things I didn't like. I remember wondering why my relatives couldn't speak English. I thought it was weird that adults weren't able to communicate with me. I also remember longing to understand them when they would laugh all together. And most of all, I didn't like all the pinching of my cheeks and my family members calling me <em>Pogi Pogi</em> (cute). If my sister didn't restrain me, I probably would have kicked a lot of grandma ass.

I can`t believe it has been almost 20 years. I definitely hope to visit again sometime in the future.
