<strong>Verse 1</strong>

Step by step, I’ve tried to walk in straight lines,

Take the path that’s been most traveled by,

Paint Colors in Black and White,

I can't but think, as I watch the flowers

Bloom in spring, that maybe there's something I am missing

As time transforms my body,

And if disease moves through my body,

I hope I don't lose sight of love,

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Verse 2</strong>

When I was young, you held me close in your arms,

I love every moment, cause you kept me safe and warm,

I see you in the spring here in all the flowers that bloom,

And hear you when the wind passes through my home

As life changes with the seasons,

The cold will surely come,

But I’ll love those around me and hold on.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Refrain</strong>

For love is our light,

For love gives us sight,

Love is our light
